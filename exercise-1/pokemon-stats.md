# ðŸ“Š Pokemon Stats 

## Goal:

Given a list of Pokemon in `pokemon.json` and the `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon` API write a program
that calculates the following:

1. Who is the tallest Pokemon?
2. What is the average weight of all the Pokemon?
3. Which Pokemon has the most abilities?
4. **Bonus**: What ability is shared the most between all the Pokemon?

Results can be written to `stdout` in whatever format you choose.

As you write your solution think through the following:

1. Error handling: How should the program behave if there is an error fetching a Pokemon?
2. Code Structure: How readable is the solution? Is it testable?
3. Performance: How does the program scale as the list of Pokemon grows?
