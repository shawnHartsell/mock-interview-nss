# Pair Programming Exercise

For this exercise, we'll work together to list GitHub repositories for a user. In the interest of time we will the against mock API endpoints


**Get a User by id**: https://run.mocky.io/v3/59e8fa9a-b488-4ab7-9fd6-cf6002aa0126?user_id=:id

**List repositories for a user**: https://run.mocky.io/v3/1aed64d8-96dc-4949-abb3-1134cb1e024a?user_name:user_name

## Goals

1. Implement function that takes a `user_id` as an argument. Retreive user details using the Users API
2. Using the response from the Users API, retrieve the list of repositories using the Repositories API
3. Print the list of repositories owned by the user
4. (Bonus 1) Print the list of public repositories for the user
5. (Bonus 2) Write the list of public repositories to a file called `repos.txt`

You are free to use whatever tools, language, and documentation you'd like ðŸš€
