# Pair Programming Exercise

For this exercise, we'll work together to create our own implementation of a queue of integers. As per Wikipedia, a queue is:

> a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence

Queues typically provide the following functions 3 function(s). For our purposes, we will create a queue for integers

- *Enqueue(n int)* = add an integer to the back of the queue
- *Dequeue(n int): int* = removes the first integer from the queue and returns it
- *Peek(n int): int* = returns the integer at the front of the queue without removing it

## Goals

1. Create a data structure for the three functions above (hint: think class, interfaces, object literals, etc)
2. Implement the 3 functions
3. Create an instance of the queue, enqueue a list of integers
4. Dequeue the elements until the queue is empty, printing each item as we go along

You are free to use whatever language you'd like as well as documentation. The only requirement is to not use a built-in queue in your preferred language!
